Prototype online competitive snake

Imagine your classic Nokia snake game, now with 2 players! Compete over food and cut off your opponents to win.

Rule:

* Match: First to 7 Match Points, with infinite Deuce (when both players get 6 Set Points)
* Game:
  * Each Food eaten will either increase the snake's Advantage Point by 1 if the opponent doesn't have any Advantage Points, or decrease the opponent's Advantage Points by 1
  * A Snake can only have 5 Advantage Point
  * When a player gets 5 Advantage Point, they enter "Hunter Mode"
  * In "Hunter Mode", that snake can win by eating the other snake's tail or win by normal means
  * If a snake wins in "Hunter Mode", it will gain 2 Set Points
